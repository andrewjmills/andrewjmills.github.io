		<h2>“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.” –C.G. Jung</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Personal characteristics we find undesirable are filtered out through the ego via persona and kept hidden from the outside world.  According to Jung, these are collectively known as the <em>shadow</em>.</li>
			<li>The shadow is akin to a combination of the blind, hidden, and unknown areas of the Johari Window, consistent with Jung’s belief that the unconscious dwarfs the conscious in scope. </li>
			<li>Though hidden, these traits are ever present and very active within our unconscious.  It is therefore imperative to explore this “dark side” of our personality and attempt to understand, accept, integrate, and control it.</li>
		</ul>

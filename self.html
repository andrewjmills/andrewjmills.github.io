		<p>The center, defining piece of our mental nature; union of conscious and unconscious; archetype of totality; an immensely complex result of dynamic, constant interplay between all elements within the psychic architecture.</p>
		<img src="images/balance.jpg" alt="Mental Balance Yin-Yang" height="400" width="500">
		<p>Balance is the end-goal, but only realistically attainable through averages by remaining self-aware, continually correcting through lifeâ€™s peaks and valleys.</p>
		<img src="images/mandala.jpg" alt="Wheel-of-Life Mandala" height="600" width="400">
		<p>Symbology has displayed this as a common human thread throughout time. In the words of Jung:<br> <em>It is not without importance for us to appreciate the high value set upon the mandala, for it accords very well with the paramount significance of individual mandala symbols which are characterized by the same qualities of a - so to speak - "metaphysical" nature. Unless everything deceives us, they signify nothing less than a specific centre of the personality not to be identified with the ego.</em> (carl-	jung.net, n.d.)</p>
